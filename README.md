[PROJECT 1 : FACE MASK DETECTION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK](https://github.com/PravilaDsouza/FaceMask_Detection)

This is a project I did for my masters, where I build a real time face mask detection system for a face dataase.

Data was taken from the kaggle repository
The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.
